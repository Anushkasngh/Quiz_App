![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RameezAhmed/Quiz_App/master/Quiz_App-pic.png)

This is a project I developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP and MySQL.
I created a database using MySQL which holds users that register through the
application and used PHP to save the user data to the MySQL database. 

In-Progress:
Using PHP for user authentication on Log-In page.
