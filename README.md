This is a project I developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP and MySQL.
I created a database using MySQL which holds users that register through the
application and used PHP to save the user data to the MySQL database. 

The quiz consists of five multiple choice questions which I stored as objects in
an array called 'questions'. I then used jQuery to dynamically add the questions 
to the page. User score is displayed once all five questions have been answered. 

In-Progress:
Using PHP for user authentication on Log-In page.
